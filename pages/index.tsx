        Hi! I’m Finn, a student Multimedia and Creative Technology at Erasmus
        Colleges Brussels. I’m passionate about creating and love anything
        technology-related. During my education in Multimedia and Creative
        Technology I’ve grown a big interest for the front-end, the back-end and
        everything in between.
